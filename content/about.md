# About me!

I'm a young game developer looking to make a splash in the industry! I'm primarily a game programmer, but I also have experience in narrative and design work. I'll jump at any chance to be creative!

I have an interest in game AI, especially NPC behaviors. I really enjoy GOAP as an AI behavior technique, and am always looking to gain more experience with it (or other methods)! In addition to AI, I enjoy UI, particularly when it comes to video games. I enjoy menu and HUD design/implementation a lot!

Outside of work, I love to play video games (of course), write, and be creative! I play guitar and crochet little plushies sometimes, and I love to try new hobbies when I get the chance. My favorite video games are *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth*, *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, and *Stardew Valley*.
